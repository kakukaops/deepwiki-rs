phase: generation
purpose: |
  Generate clear, structured, and professional documentation
  based on the analyzed architecture and discovered project data.

prerequisites:
  - architecture.outputs.identified_modules
  - architecture.outputs.inferred_architecture_patterns
  - architecture.outputs.c4_context_definition
  - architecture.outputs.c4_container_definition
  - architecture.outputs.c4_component_definition

objectives:
  - Produce a complete set of technical documentation
  - Ensure logical flow and clear separation of concerns
  - Maintain consistency across all generated documents

documentation_set:

  project_overview:
    intent: |
      Provide a high-level introduction to the project.
    should_include:
      - Project purpose and scope
      - Key features and responsibilities
      - Primary technologies and frameworks
    should_not_include:
      - Low-level implementation details

  architecture_overview:
    intent: |
      Explain the system architecture and major components.
    should_include:
      - Architectural style and rationale
      - Major containers and components
      - High-level interaction flows
    dependencies:
      - c4_models

  workflow_overview:
    intent: |
      Describe key workflows and execution paths.
    should_include:
      - Core business flows
      - Data movement between components
      - External interactions
    guidance:
      - Focus on representative paths
      - Avoid exhaustive edge cases

  deep_dive:
    intent: |
      Document important modules or components in detail.
    scope_rules:
      - Select only critical or complex components
      - Avoid duplicating architecture overview content
    should_include:
      - Responsibilities
      - Key interfaces
      - Internal logic summaries

generation_rules:
  - Maintain consistent terminology across documents
  - Cross-link related sections where appropriate
  - Prefer clarity over exhaustiveness
  - Assume reader has general technical background

output_organization:
  directory_structure:
    - docs/
    - docs/architecture/
    - docs/workflows/
    - docs/components/
  file_naming:
    - use-kebab-case
    - descriptive-and-consistent

generation_constraints:
  - do_not_generate_diagrams_here
  - do_not_validate_quality_here
  - do_not_inline_templates

outputs:
  - project_overview_doc
  - architecture_overview_doc
  - workflow_overview_doc
  - deep_dive_docs
