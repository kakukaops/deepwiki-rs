phase: qa
purpose: |
  Validate the generated documentation and diagrams for
  completeness, accuracy, consistency, and usability.

prerequisites:
  - generation.outputs.project_overview_doc
  - generation.outputs.architecture_overview_doc
  - generation.outputs.workflow_overview_doc
  - generation.outputs.deep_dive_docs
  - diagrams.outputs.system_context_diagrams
  - diagrams.outputs.container_diagrams
  - diagrams.outputs.component_diagrams
  - diagrams.outputs.workflow_diagrams

objectives:
  - Ensure documentation is complete and coherent
  - Verify alignment between text and diagrams
  - Detect omissions, inconsistencies, or ambiguities
  - Produce a concise final summary

quality_checks:

  completeness:
    checklist:
      - All planned documents are generated
      - Each document has required sections
      - Key components and workflows are covered

  consistency:
    checklist:
      - Terminology is consistent across documents
      - Component names match between text and diagrams
      - Architecture descriptions align with diagrams

  clarity:
    checklist:
      - Explanations are clear and concise
      - No unnecessary duplication
      - Logical flow between sections

  diagram_validation:
    checklist:
      - Diagrams accurately reflect described architecture
      - Diagrams are readable and not overcrowded
      - Mermaid syntax renders correctly

finalization:
  summary_guidelines:
    - Summarize system purpose and scope
    - Highlight key architectural decisions
    - Mention notable constraints or assumptions

qa_constraints:
  - do_not_introduce_new_features
  - do_not_change_architecture_decisions
  - do_not_expand_scope

outputs:
  - validated_documentation_set
  - validation_report
  - final_summary
