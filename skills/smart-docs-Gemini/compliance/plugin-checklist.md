# QA Checklist

Before finalizing any document, verify:

1.  [ ] **No Hallucinations**: Do the cited file paths actually exist in the `tree` output?
2.  [ ] **Diagram Syntax**: Is the Mermaid syntax valid?
3.  [ ] **Language Idioms**: Does the documentation speak the language? (e.g., Don't call a Rust struct a "Class").
4.  [ ] **C4 Compliance**: Do diagrams clearly distinguish Context, Container, and Component?
5.  [ ] **Completeness**: Are all "Deep Dive" components mentioned in the "Architecture Overview"?
